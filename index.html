                    <h3>Week 1 Discussion: Industry Reasearch and Project Intent</h3>
                    <h4>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only? (just a hint - iOS can be the tricky one)</h4>
                    <p>Javascript often uses a "bridge" such as PhoneGap to access things like the accelerometer, camera, compass, contacts, geolocation, media, notifications and storage.  HTML5 contains audio and video elements. CSS can be used to make media queries and play with transitions.
                    </p>
                    <h4>For your CRUD app revision, which of these do you think you will implement?</h4>
                    <p>I'd love to get local storage completely working in my CRUD App.  It is only partially working at this time.  I think it would be very cool to utilize the geolocation in such a way that users would be able to identify other users nearby and compare notes with them.  Of course, they can compare notes with users who are far away as well and it would be interesting to see where people are playing the game worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h4>
                    <p>I found that it is very important to keep everything organized in appropriate folders.  If I'm going to make large changes in my code, I create a back-up copy of the original in case I spin off on a tangent that doesn't go anywhere.  As far as research, everything is still hit and miss with me.  Sometimes I can find tons of information and other times I'm at a loss as to what to look for.  Design is sometimes even more difficult than implementation.  I often find that I have a hard time choosing colors that I'm happy with and deciding on the flow of the UI is sometimes challenging as well.  It takes test after test to find what it is that gives the best user experience.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Please describe any design intentions you may have for the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app.</h4>
                    <p>I would like my Demo App to be similar in color scheme to my CRUD app.  I may not like it when I actually implement it, but that will be my first design choice.  I think that I will also eventually veer away from using jQuery mobile as I find it to be generic looking.  I am hoping to create something that is cleaner,  and leaner but just as functional as jQuery mobile.  So it is very likely that the whole look and feel of the app will evolve into something that I feel personally more pleasing.  Perhaps bits of jQuery will remain.  It will depend on what I can come up with.
                    </p>
                    <h4>If not covered above, please also describe any functionality intentions you may have for both the AVF Demo app and the revised/new version of your CRUD app
                    </h4>
                    <p>I know that I need to find a way to navigate from my CRUD app on cloudant back to my design app on iOS devices that don't have an available back button.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Week 2 Discussion: Accessibility</h3>
                    <h4>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h4>
                    <p>Using semantic markup is probably the most efficient way to make my app more accessible.  I already use div, section, img, and basics like that.  I could add other tags to render video such as video, source, track and call upon javascript to help users navigate the contents.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" - what are some of the common frustrations that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them?</h4>
                    <p>There are many sites that just aren't optimized to be utilized by screenreaders.  Users get frustrated by not being able to navigate through the page and the service becomes totally useless for the impaired consumer.  Being aware of this demographic and the best practices in optimization is the best way to fix these problems.   With this being my first exposure to accessibility (for it has never entered my train of thought that blind people would use the internet – a bit of naiveté, or perhaps insensitivity on my part), I would definitely feel compelled to look into what I can do to create functionality for everyone who would use my applications.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h4>
                    <p>The iPad has received rave reviews for accessibility right out of the box with only a small learning curve.  The iPad's features include voice over, gestures, text navigation.  The iPhone and iPod touch also features the same sort of accessibility but the iPad's larger structure adds more functionality for the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although not a device, Android 2.0 and higher offer accessibility features such as Text To Speech (in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German), improved keyboard, Project Eyes-Free that has accessibility tools like TalkBack, APIs to create things like screenreaders, and haptic feedback which uses the sense of touch and employing forces, vibrations, and/or motions upon the user.  All stuff to keep in mind while designing apps for Android. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h4>
                    <p>Two social apps for Android that were tested using TalkBack (one of the official Google accessibility services) are Facebook by Facebook and Foursquare by foursquare.

                    <h3>Week 3 Discussion: Trends</h3>
					<h4>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</h4>
                    <p>My research seems to indicate that games are the top selling category in the U.S.   Game apps are followed by entertainment apps and then social networking apps.</p>
					<h4>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</h4>
                    <p>It seems that the Japanese are interested in the same things as Americans and their top app categories coincide with those of the U.S. – games, entertainment, social networking.</p>
					<h4>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</h4>
                    <p>What I found for Great Britain was a toss up depending on where I looked.  Many sites lumped Great Britain with America and so the data shows that games are the highest rated category.  But if you go off of other sites for what’s hot in Great Britain during any given week, there is data to support that map apps for guiding you to places were top selling and sometimes apps that kept you organized were top selling.</p>
					<h4>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h4>
                    <p>I would have to say that worldwide, people love to be entertained.  They love the escape factor of being able to spend a couple minutes on a game level in between real life tasks.  People also like to keep in touch with those that they know and be able to share things with them throughout the day.  Social networking has changed the way the world interacts.</p>
					<h4>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h4>
					<p>Android users account for just over 40% of the Mobile OS market in America, just over 20% in the United Kingdom, and in Japan they account for just under 48%.  Not only that, it seems that Android jumped from 9.6% of the smartphone global market share in 2010 to 36% of smartphone global market share in 2011.  That is a jump to be noticed and to take advantage of while Android is popular (although another source projects that Android users would total over 48% by 2015). I would say that if you were to develop for Android you might want to concentrate your efforts in games or entertainment apps for the U.S. and Japanese markets and do it while it is trending upwards in sales. </p>
					<h4>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</h4>
					<p>I just could not find the appropriate information to answer this question.  I did find out that apps are beginning to get more bandwidth intensive and carriers are trying to figure out ways to regulate how much bandwidth an individual can use.</p>
					<h4>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</h4>
					<p>If you were just to look at the numbers, you’d see that Android is rapidly gaining almost half of the smartphone market.  All other devices are still out there in varying degrees.  What you have to remember is that even if iOS is only capturing 16% of the total market, they are representing 16% of millions of people. This, of course, translates to lots and lots of users.  Also, from what I have heard from people currently in the industry in my neck of the woods, Android users are notoriously “thrifty” as opposed to iOS users who are willing to pay for anything of quality.  So it is conceivable that if you are looking to monetize anything in mobile, you can get better returns in the iOS market.

					All that being said, there is the ease of being able to get your app to market to consider.  The Apple App Store is known to be quite picky while the open source and less stringent policies for the Android market make listing an app much easier than the App Store.

					Choosing who to create apps for would depend on the demographics you are trying to reach and what it is you want to achieve.  Are you trying to make money or is the app something that enhances another product that already makes money?  Game apps are the most downloaded but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for every other conceivable type of app that you could produce.  So, while trends are important, niche markets can also be viable as well as producing something that you love.  Chances are that if you are interested in a particular subject or genre, there will be others out there that will share this love with you and are looking for an app just like yours.

					After all that, I guess I would recommend that focus should be placed on creating an app that is easy and intuitive, either useful or fun (or both), and that  can be used almost without thinking.  Whatever you create needs to be high quality and the word will get out.
